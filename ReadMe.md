<b>Social Media Blog API</b>

<b>Overview:</b>

  This social media application will be an api backend without a frontend. The app will have the ability to manage user accounts and messages that they submit to the application. Users will be able to see all of the messages posted to the site as well as the messages posted by a particular user. In either case, we require a backend which is able to deliver the data needed to display this information as well as process actions like logins, registrations, message creations, message updates, and message deletions.

<b>Features:</b>
 - Processing new user registrations and logins
 - Creating and retrieving all messages
 - The ability to individually search, update, and delete messages by ID

<b>Technologies:</b>
 - Java
 - Javalin
 - JDBC
